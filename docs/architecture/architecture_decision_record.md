# Pattern Agentic Website Architecture: Official Plan of Record

## Decision Record

**Date:** May 11, 2025  
**Project:** Pattern Agentic Placeholder Site  
**Decision Maker:** Roo (Architecture Mode)  
**Status:** Approved

## Selected Architecture: Option 3 - Hybrid Approach with Progressive Enhancement

After analyzing the current implementation and planned architecture, we have officially selected **Option 3: Hybrid Approach with Progressive Enhancement** as the plan of record for the Pattern Agentic website.

### Architecture Description

The hybrid approach provides a balanced solution that:
1. Enhances the current static site immediately
2. Prepares for progressive implementation of a template-based system
3. Maintains flexibility to adapt as requirements evolve

### Key Components

- Well-structured index.html with content placeholders
- External CSS and minimal JavaScript
- Preparation for future template integration
- Optional build script for future enhancement

### Implementation Phases

1. **Phase 1: Enhanced Static Site**
   - Restructure index.html with proper sections
   - Extract inline styles to external CSS
   - Optimize animations and effects
   - Ensure mobile responsiveness

2. **Phase 2: Content Preparation**
   - Validate and enhance content.json
   - Ensure all required content sections are present
   - Prepare content structure for templating

3. **Phase 3: Template Integration**
   - Create templates directory with base.html
   - Develop build.js script based on examples/build.js
   - Test build process with content.json
   - Deploy generated static site

### Rationale for Selection

Option 3 was selected over the alternatives because it:
- Provides immediate improvement to the current site
- Creates a clear pathway to the full template system
- Balances simplicity with maintainability
- Allows for incremental implementation
- Minimizes risk while maximizing flexibility

This approach aligns with both the current implementation and the planned architecture while providing a clear path forward.

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Enhanced Static Site
**Description:** Improve the current static HTML approach with better organization and styling.

**Pros:**
- Simplest implementation
- Fast loading (minimal dependencies)
- Easy to deploy (GitHub Pages ready)

**Cons:**
- Limited maintainability for future updates
- Content changes require HTML edits
- Doesn't leverage the content.json structure

### Option 2: Template-Based Build System
**Description:** Implement the architecture described in dev_plan.json.

**Pros:**
- Content separated from presentation
- More maintainable for future updates
- Follows the planned architecture

**Cons:**
- Requires build step for changes
- More complex implementation
- Needs additional directories and files

## Next Steps

We are now ready to begin implementation of Phase 1 of the hybrid approach, focusing on enhancing the current static site while preparing for future template integration.
